Website : https://sharishkumar192.github.io/Simply-Book/Website/src/index.html

This project was to create a Machine Learning based Android mobile application & Website integrated withthe chat-bot, where the App gets the userâ€™s image as input then redirect the results to a Website. The Websitedisplays the list of E-books that is closely related to the input given so that the user can get the book thatthey require. If the user already knows the name of the book and only needs the book, then the user can go tothe website and get the book directly using the help of a chat-bot just by typing the name of the book in it.
